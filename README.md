## Project Instructions

https://teamtreehouse.com/projects/build-a-course-rating-api-with-express

In this project, you’ll create a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to review educational courses: users can see a list of courses in a database; add courses to the database; and add reviews for a specific course.

To complete this project, you’ll use your knowledge of REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with Mongoose and MongoDB for data modeling, validation, and persistence.

In addition to common developer tools like Postman, we’ve provided you with an AngularJS single page application that you can use to test and exercise your REST API. The AngularJS application includes views to display a list of courses, display the details for a course including reviews and ability to post/delete a review, create or update a course, register a user, and login a user.
